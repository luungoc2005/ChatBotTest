# Training details. We train 2-layer LSTMs of 512 units with bidirectional encoder (i.e., 1 bidirectional layers for the encoder), embedding dim is 512. LuongAttention (scale=True) is used together with dropout keep_prob of 0.8. All parameters are uniformly. We use SGD with learning rate 1.0 as follows: train for 12K steps (~ 12 epochs); after 8K steps, we start halving learning rate every 1K step.
